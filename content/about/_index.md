My journey into software engineering began in an unexpected place: customizing pet pages on Neopets in the early 2000s. I was fascinated by how just a few lines of code could change how things looked and behaved on screen. It felt like magic.

What started as a hobby quickly grew into a deeper curiosity about how the internet works. That deep curiosity led me from creating simple layouts to writing scripts, tinkering with backend servers, and eventually building full web applications from scratch. Those early experiments laid the foundation for my skills in both front-end and back-end development.

Today, I’m a full-stack software engineer with a strong focus on flexibility, maintainability, and user experience. I turn ideas into intuitive, responsive websites that my clients love. I volunteer a lot and mentoring new developers, helping them just like others once helped me.

And most importantly? 

That original sense of fun, creativity, and discovery from my Neopets days has never left. I’m still that passionate, curious developer who loves to learn, experiment, and explore new technologies.
