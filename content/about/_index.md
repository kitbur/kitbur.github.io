My journey into software engineering began in an unexpected place: customizing pet pages on Neopets in the early 2000s. I was fascinated by how just a few lines of code could change how things looked and behaved on screen. 

It felt like magic.

What started as a hobby quickly grew into a deeper curiosity about how the internet works. Creating simple profile layouts turned into writing scripts, navigating backend servers, and eventually, building robust web applications from scratch. Those early experiments laid the foundation for my skills in both front-end and back-end development.

Today, I'm a full-stack software engineer with a strong focus on flexibility, maintainability, and user experience. I turn ideas into intuitive, responsive websites that my clients love. I give back to the community by contributing to open source projects, and by mentoring new developers.

Most importantly, the original sense of fun, creativity, and discovery from my Neopets days has never left me. I'm a passionate, curious developer who loves to tinker, learn, and explore new technologies.
