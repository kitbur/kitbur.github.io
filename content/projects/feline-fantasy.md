To demonstrate the ability to build captivating, high-performance marketing assets, I designed and developed Feline Fantasy as a professional-grade proof-of-concept from scratch.

This project tackles a common challenge for independent game studios: how to create a promotional site that delivers a AAA-quality user experienceâ€”vibrant, dynamic, and memorable, while remaining lightweight and performant.

## Strategic UI/UX Design

The project was designed and built mobile-first from the ground up. I utilized Tailwind CSS to rapidly develop a complex, responsive layout with a utility-first approach, ensuring a polished and consistent look across all devices.

## Framework-Free Interactivity

To create a lively and engaging experience, all interactive elements were built using vanilla JavaScript. By directly manipulating the DOM, the site achieves dynamic effects and animations without the overhead of a larger front-end framework, guaranteeing optimal performance.

## Code Craftsmanship

The final product is a demonstration of clean, semantic HTML and efficient JavaScript, proving that a feature-rich user experience can be delivered with a lean and maintainable codebase.
