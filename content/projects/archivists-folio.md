Archivist's Folio is a bespoke digital gallery commissioned by a client to be a sleek, modern, and fully responsive showcase for their work. The repository is private due to proprietary code.

The project's core challenge was to balance two high-priority goals: delivering a visually-rich, exceptionally performant experience for visitors, while simultaneously providing the artist with a completely frictionless system to manage their own content.

To overcome these challenges, I chose a modern static site architecture. I built the website using Jekyll to ensure maximum performance and security, then installed and configured Sveltia CMS. This provided the client with a simple, intuitive interface to manage their content.
