This project was a commission to create a premier digital gallery for a professional artist. The repository is private as it contains proprietary code developed for the client.

## The Challenge

The client's primary business need presented a common technical challenge: how to create a portfolio that was both visually stunning and exceptionally fast for visitors, while also being simple enough for a non-technical user to manage independently, saving them time and money on future updates.

## My Solution

The solution was to architect a modern Jamstack site. By building the front-end with the static site generator Jekyll, we could guarantee maximum security and millisecond load times. This was then paired with an integrated Sveltia CMS, which provided the artist with an intuitive, git-based interface to update their gallery without technical assistance.

This headless CMS approach successfully achieved both core objectives, delivering a best-in-class visitor experience and complete content management autonomy for the client.
