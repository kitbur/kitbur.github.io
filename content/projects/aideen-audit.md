This financial planning tool was developed as a full-featured, single-page application with a focus on data accuracy, user experience, and a professional, maintainable codebase.

- **Data Pipeline & Automation:** Features a custom data pipeline built with Python to automatically scrape and process regional pricing data. This script generates a clean JSON file that serves as a local API for the front-end, ensuring the calculator's cost estimations are accurate and easily updatable.

- **Complex Calculation Engine:** The core logic models and calculates costs based on complex, probabilistic in-game mechanics, including two different end thresholds, the 50/50 guarantee system, and individual first-time purchase bonuses.

- **Polished User Experience:** Built with a focus on intuitive design, the application includes a real-time validation system with animated feedback, a fully responsive layout for all devices, and a seamless, single-page feel with smooth panel transitions.

- **Modern JavaScript Architecture:** Initially a single script, the entire application was refactored into a scalable, modular architecture using ES6 modules. This enforces a clean separation of concerns between the UI, state management, validation, and business logic, resulting in a professional and maintainable codebase.
